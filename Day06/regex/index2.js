Four men are set to be executed in the U.S. this week as the nation experiences the single busiest month for the death penalty in nearly 15 years.

On Tuesday, Oct. 14, Missouri and Florida are scheduled to execute inmates within an hour of each other. The next day, Mississippi is set to carry out another execution and Arizona has one on Friday. Victims of the inmates include a family of four, a college student kidnapped from her bedroom, and a state trooper who was ambushed in his driveway.

The executions are among seven this month. If all of them move forward, it will be the single busiest month for executions in the U.S. since May 2011. That's according to a USA TODAY analysis of a database kept by the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that tracks the use of the death penalty in the U.S. without taking a position on it.
